I am not familiar with this specific amplifier, but the principles for
using MOSFET's is the same.

There are two types of MOSFET's: RF mosfet's and switching mosfets.  The
RF mosfets are $30-40 each, so seldom seen in amateur work.  That leaves
the cheaper switching mosfet's, such as the IRF510.  These are designed
to be a switch ... ON or OFF.  In between these two states is a small
linear region.  This is where most QRP PA's are supposedly designed to
operate.  In the case of the IRF510, the mosfet "turns on" with a gate
voltage around 3.5-4.0v, and goes fully on (called the "full ohmic on
region") with around 7-8v on the gate.  The exact ON and OFF voltages on
the gate will vary tremendously from one IRF510 to the next.  When you
build an IRF510 PA, you should characterize that particular mosfet so
you know exactly at what gate voltage drain current starts to flow, and
if possible, at what gate voltage the drain current becomes maximum, or
the point of the full-ohmic-on region.

If you spend too much time in the full-ohmic-on region, you are drawing
excessive current not being transformed to output power, which is
dissipated across the source-drain junction ... that is, excessive HEATING
of the IRF510.

Per the above, it is more important to characterize the biasing points of
your IRF510's.  You'll need to monitor BOTH the drain and gate voltages
simultaneously with either a DVM and/or an oscope.  With no gate voltage,
the IRF510 will be OFF, such that you will have +12V on the drain (or
whatever your raw Vcc is).

Connect a 10K or so pot between ground and +12, such that the wiper then
will go from 0V to +12v.  Connect the wiper to the gate.  Initially set it
to 0v and record the drain voltage.  Say it is +12v.

Now increase the voltage on the gate until the drain voltage begins to
drop by the smallest amount you can detect.  Usually 100-200mV should be
obvious on most DVM's or scopes.  Say this happens with the gate voltage
at 3.8v.  This is the gate turn-ON voltage: 3.8v

Now increase the gate voltage and watch the drain voltage go down ...
10v, 8v, 6v, etc.  Be quick at this.  You may need to turn the gate
voltage to 0v if the IRF510 starts getting too hot doing this before doing
it again.  What you are looking for is increasing the gate voltage and
watching for the point where the drain voltage no longer gets any lower.
Say this happens with a gate voltage of 7.8v and a drain voltage of 1v.
If you increase the gate voltage to 8v, the drain voltage stays at 1v.
You are defining the dynamic range of the LINEAR region.  In this case,
the linear region is a gate voltage from 3.8v to 7.8v ... producing a
drain voltage that varies from +12v down to +1v.  Another way to look at
it is the mosfet turns ON with a gate voltage of 3.8v (which means it is
OFF below 3.8v), and the "switch" (the IRF510) is fully ON with a gate
voltage of 7.8v.  This is the gate voltage range you MUST operate within!
But remember, with the gate voltage at 7.8v, producing a drain voltage of
1v, you are now drawing FULL CURRENT, which for the IRF510 is around 5A!
(Assuming your power supply can provide that).

For accuracy, there is one additional test you need to perform.  For a
typical 5W QRP PA running class C (50% efficiency), a drain current of
about 1A is usually required.  In this case, 12V x 1A = 12W input power,
yielding an efficiency of 5W/12W = 42% (fairly typical inspite of the
amazing efficiency claims made by some).  How much current does your rig
draw to make 5W?  Figure out the efficiency yourself using the above.
Subtract the receive current from the transmit current to be a purist.

But this 1A is rms, meaning the IFR510 will be drawing about 1.5A on the
peaks (1A x 1.414).  So you need to find out at what gate voltage produces
a drain current flow of 1.5A.  To do this, you must monitor the drain
current flow (either in the drain lead, or between the power supply and
the rig, providing you subtract out the receive or standby current on
key  up).

Let's say you parallel some resistors to achieve 1-ohm in the drain lead.
This means when you drop 1.5V across this 1-ohm resistor, your drain
current is about 1.5A.

Now increase your pot/gate voltage again until you see your 1.5V drop
across the 1-ohm resistor, identifying 1.5A of drain current.  Say this
occurs at 7.4v on the gate.  This identifies the true dynamic range you
need to operate your IRF510 inside of ... a gate voltage from 3.8V
(turn ON) to 7.4v for 1.5A peak of drain current.

HERE'S THE BIGGEST MISTAKE MOST IRF510 CIRCUITS MAKE:
=====================================================

You go keydown for transmit, and adjust the bias for 5W output.  When you
go keyup, the IRF510 should TURN OFF.  But if the bias is set too high,
above 3.8v gate turn on in this example, your IRF510 will be drawing
current, perhaps several hundred mA of current if you don't check.  This,
of course, is wasted power and needlessly heating up your IRF510.

IRF510's are SWITCHING MOSFET'S ... there is absolutely NO NEED to set
this so-called "idling current" in a mosfet.  On keyup, there should be
NONE, ZERO, ZIP drain current flowing in the IRF510.

If you set your bias for 5W out, and you still have drain current flowing
on key-up, your problem is simple: INSUFFICIENT GATE DRIVE -- not biasing.
You do not have enough peak-to-peak RF drive going to the gate.  This is
the biggest problem I've seen with most published IRF510 circuits ...
insufficient gate drive!

Back to our example, the gate turns ON at 3.8v and the drain draws 1.5A
at 7.4V.  This is 3.6v difference.  Your RF drive needs to be AT LEAST
twice this! (or 7.2Vpp).

MY RECOMMENDATION with the above example, is to bias the gate around
0.5v below the gate turn on voltage ... or 3.8 - 0.5v = 3.3V.  With no
input signal, this will ensure the IRF510 is completely turned off
(with the gate turn on voltage of 3.8v).  The input RF drive signal should
be capacitively coupled, so that with no RF drive, the gate voltage is
this 3.3v, and the IRF510 is turned OFF.

For proper class C biasing, your input drive should be twice your gate
input biasing range, that is, twice the 3.8v (turn ON) to 7.4v (Id=1.5A),
or about 7.2Vpp RF drive at the driver output, feeding the coupling
capacitor between the drive and gate input circuit.  The first 3.8v will
do nothing (except help charge up the gate-source capacitance ... about
150pF).  Then when it exceeds the 3.8v bias, the IRF510 will begin to
conduct.  When the input drive reaches the maximum of 7.2v, this will be
the MOMENTARY point of maximum 1.5A drain current, corresponding to about
1A rms drain current.

So to properly bias an IRF510, you need to know at what gate voltage
drain current BEGINS to flow, at what gate voltage produces about 1.5A
of drain current, and at what gate voltage causes FULL current flow.
In most IRF510's, the difference in gate voltage between 1.5A and full
drain current is 0.5V or even less.  Fairly critical.

The last problem, of course, is if you have too much gate drive, say
8-9V peak.  This is because (in our example), once the gate voltage
exceeds the 7.4v (1.5A drain current point), much above that, the
IRF510 will be drawing it's full 5A of current over some portion of the
input sinewave, usually 10-25% of the cycle.  This excess power does
two bad things:
1) It saturates the toroidal core being used in the drain circuit for
   the RFC or transformer primarily (usually a 1:4 bifilar wound
   transformer).  This inductance can not get rid of all of its stored
   up current into the output filter before the next drain current cycle
   begins if it goes into core saturation.  A T50-43 core will saturate
   around 2A peak current.
2) The excess current has no place to go except to dissipate in the form
   of heat across the drain-source junction.  This will make the IRF510
   VERY, VERY HOT in short order.  The kind of heat that removes your
   finger print!

In this full-drain current (full-ohmic on) condition, another bad thing
needs to be pointed out:  We know that the approximate output resistance
of any PA transistor or mosfet is the famous RL=Vcc^2/2Po, which equates
to about 14 ohms at 12V and 5W output.  When you enter the full ohmic-on
region, the output resistance then becomes the Rds of the IRF510, which
is about 0.4ohms.  Drop nearly 12V at 5A across a 0.4 ohm resistor, and
buddy -- you're making some major heat. (P=EI = 12V x 5A = 60Watts!).
The maximum power dissipation of an IRF510 is about 40W.  Ooops ...
something has got to give.  Poof - there goes your IRF510 after about
5 seconds of keydown.

So, for each IRF510 you build a PA out of, characterize the gate voltage
required for gate turn on, 1.5A of drain current, and where it goes into
it's full ohmic-on region (full drain current flow).  This defines your
effective dynamic range of RF drive, and the safe operating area you
should remain within.

If you built an IRF510 from somebody's article that says to set 50mA or so
of idle current on key-up, immediately drop the gate bias a bit until
NO DRAIN CURRENT flows.  And if you can't get 5W out at this point, then
increase your RF drive.  Or, if it's getting too hot, then check that
you don't have too much drive, drawing more than 1A rms, or that the
gate is not exceeding 8V (or whatever you measured) on the peaks.

MOSFET PA's make neat amplifiers, but due to the large variations from
one device to the next, they are not as reliable to build as a BJT
PA using a 2SC2078 or something.  This is why each IRF510 should be
characterized before building the PA to establish the proper bias point.

> What do you say? Would this be a cool move or what?

By setting the PROPER BIAS POINT AND RF DRIVE, you shouldn't have to
piddle around with diode temperature compensation or bias feedback
networks to make the IRF510 work properly.

It's OK for the IRF510 to get fairly hot after 5-10 seconds of keydown
with a class C 5W PA, but if you're leaving finger prints ... then it's
way too hot and it is not properly biased or driven.

FALSE.  This is one of the major points of yesterday's post.  You want to
AVOID driving a mosfet so hard that the drain current saturates, because
in the case of the IRF510, you will suddenly be drawing 5-6 amps and your
output load resistance drops to 0.4 ohms - making an impedance match to
your 50-ohm filter network impossible.  The 5-6A of drain current, even
if only 10-20% of the RF cycle, raises your average drain current over
rms by that same percentage, and lowers your efficiency by the same
percentage.  And with 5-6A flowing through the IRF510, even 10-20% of the
time, is still a lot of power being converted to nothing but heat inside
the IRF510.  You want to avoid saturating the drain current at all costs.

Except, of course, in the case of Class E, which exploits operating the
IRF510 in the saturated drain current region.  But here, you are not
driving the mosfet with a sinewave, but rather fairly narrow "pulses" to
convert the 5-6A of drain current to the desired 1A average current.
Actually, it ends up being less than that for efficiencies in the
80-90% range.  But that is also due to doing business a bit different
in the output filter and how one impedance matches the IRF510 to the
50-ohm filter.  But in any case, you never drive a mosfet in class D, E
or F with a sinewave.

TRUE.  Filtering does need to be more precisely matched to a mosfet PA
depending upon the exact class of operation it is in.

> I would be careful not to overdrive the amp and flat top.

Well, this is exactly my point, and seemingly opposite of what is said
above about "driving the amp into the saturated drain current region."
There is no way to avoid flat topping when you are in the saturation
region.

This is not in any way an attack on Karl, but to emphasize and explain
why a mosfet class c amplifier, being fed with a sine wave, should never
be allowed to drive the mosfet into saturated drain current.  This is a
common mistake made by those trying to build mosfet PA's, and a major
reason why the mosfet's go poof, or get extremely hot, or sound chirpy,
because when you enter the saturated region, it's trying to draw almost
everything your power supply has to offer.  Even batteries can groan when
the load changes from 1A to 5A almost instantaneously.

Hi Paul,

    Kudos for such a lucid description of Class C mosfet biasing. I've
squirreled it away in my na5n folder. However, I do wish to point out that
the original poster was describing a mosfet push pull *linear* amp.
Remembering Bill Meara's proclivity for SSB operation on 17m, I suspect he's
looking to boost his phone signal. If, say, the Ramsey amp was designed for
operation in the Class AB-ish region, then some current would be drawn by
the finals during those moments of non-speech keydown.

    I've read W1HUE's article, <http://www.qrparci.org/east/Q_MODS5.html>,
which dispels the notion I've held that Mosfets have an absolute negative
temperature coefficient that reduces the device gain as the junction
temperature increases. So, thermally attaching the biasing diode to the
heatsink should help, provided that the bias is not initially too high. I
wonder if Bill could tell us what the gate bias voltage is and the part
number of those devices? Is there a bias adjustment?

Dave,

Using properly designed feedback networks, they will easily go up
to 17 meters.  I use a pair of MTP3055E MOSFETs in a small linear
amplifier that I designed and built for 40 and 17.  I get about
12 watts out on 40 and about 10 on 17.  The feedback circuits were
optimized for 17 meter operation.  I believe the QRP Plus rig used
an IRF510 in the final up to 6 or 10 meters, but I suspect the power
output suffers terribly up that high.

Bob:  The devices in the Ramsey Amp are MTP3055E.  I'm guessing that they
are switching MOSFETS similar to those described in Paul's excellent post.

Yea, biasing is more complicated once you leave Class C.  The Ramsey manual
advises you to monitor the current and adjust bias (no signal in) for 250
milliamps.  They have a test point in the bias circuit, and with 250 ma,
they say that point should read 3.2 to 3.5 volts.  I found that the voltage
reading I got was a bit higher -- about 4.4 volts. This confirms what Paul
said about variations in bias points.

I notice that as the amp gets warm, the idle current starts going up.  Mine
goes to about 340 milliamps after a standard length CQ.  I now have a larger
heat sink and a big old fan (tube type!) on the amp, so it is under control,
but I'd be happier if the idle current stayed put.

I'm wondering how low I can go with the idle current before I start getting
non-linear. Lower idle current would obviously keep things cooler.

I also saw the temp stabilization article you cited. Looked kind of
complicated to me. I wonder if just putting the diode on the heat sink would
work just as well. I may give this a try.

The amp is working well. Takes me from about 1 watt PEP to about 15-18 watts
PEP. "Stand by while I kick in the lin-yer OM!"  Lots of fun.

        To my way of thinking the bias point is defined by whether the
amplifier is linear or not. By linear I mean if the input is 10% 50% or
100% of maximum output the output follows that with good accuracy.

        For CW where the signal is on or off, you should bias the devices
for no drain current in the off condition, and drive the devices hard
enough to saturate drain current when on. This will result in the highest
efficiency and of course, least power to heating. Your for sure going to
need a good filter on the output. If your using push-pull your filter job
is easier because even harmonics are very low.

        Now you start to bias the devices into conduction when you need a
linear amp. This increases loss to heat and the devices get hot. 500 Ma at
12 volts is 6 watts of constant heat dissipation in the device. If you
think you need 2 amps of drain bias then the linearity is great but the
amp gets real hot.

        If I were doing this I would try Class B operation. Here there is
just a tiny drain current when no signal is present. I would be careful
not to overdrive the amp and flat top. This is very possible to set up.

 Or at least, restrict it to no greater than that value.

        I agree that if you saturate a fet the current is a maximum amount
the device can draw but this is a DC analysis of the output impedance.
Looking at the RF impedance it's actually defined from the median
impedance between cutoff which is very high and effective zero in
saturation. Actually you need a set of load lines like we had in the old
tube days. Might be fun to make them and see how they look.

        If the IRF510 has a gate type responce to it's input then it won't
work very well in RF service. I'm pretty sure that's what the device
is used for in the mass market.

Until we can get some AC analysis of this device I'm not ready to say that
you can't match the IRF510 output because I'm doing that with my SMK-1 5
watt amp which uses this device... and it works. Doesn't get hot at all.

IRF510 that we commonly see has 135 pf.

Don't take these numbers as absolute. Capacitance
changes with bias, and doesn't include Miller
capacitance from gate to drain.

Why does capacitance change from FET to FET?
These devices have many hundreds or thousands
of FETs all running in parallel, right on that single
chip. The heftier FETs have more in parallel than
the less-powerful ones. You can usually tell by the
full-ON channel resistance....when this number is
a small fraction of an ohm, its a BIG device, with
a lotta fets in parallel. The IRF510 has a channel
resistance (fully on) of about half an ohm. Not
so many fets.
    More parallel fets means more capacitance -
capacitances in parallel add. Its that simple. We
should use MOSfets in HF amps with low
capacitance - they're easier to drive. The IRF510
on-resistance of half an ohm is plenty low enough
for QRP with 12v supply. For a really powerful amp,
you'd have to use a higher supply voltage, or a
heftier MOSfet (and be prepared to drive its
larger input capacitance with a more powerful
driver stage).

    Logic-level MOSfets can help too - they turn
on with lower bias voltages, and are FULLY on
when the gate is only +5v (instead of +10v for
non-logic-level MOSfets).
    If you only have to charge gate capacitance
to 5v instead of 10v, less drive power is required.
So a IRFL510 is better than standard IRF510.

Subject: [125915] Re: Biasing MOSFETS?

Paul suggest some great ways to characterize a MOSfet's
biasing characteristics, when used as a RF power amp.

Paul also suggests some bad things that can happen when
over-driving a MOSfet...one of which is saturation of the
RFC choke feeding in DC power. Yes, that's bad, wasting
power in heat (in the choke).
    But you won't waste much power heating the FET.
When you overdrive a MOSfet (gate voltage swinging up
over approx +7v), it does turn on hard, and looks like
a small, fractional-ohm resistor. But this only happens
for a fraction of a microsecond. During that time, the
MOSfet dissipates very little power, since its drain voltage
is very nearly zero - same as the source. No voltage
across the FET?...no power dissipated - even though
there may be a lotta current running thru.
    Yes, if you LEAVE the gate at +8v, current builds
after a few microseconds and something soon gives up
the smoke - maybe the FET, maybe the choke. But
that's not how it runs in an amp - the FET only asks
for current in short, sub-microsecond pulses. So Paul's
smoky scenario when overdriving is not likely, if you
stay within reasonable limits....

As long as the choke can stand the current, overdriving
a MOSfet likely improves efficiency, making the FET
run cooler. There'll be a bit more current in the choke,
and a bit more current in the FET, but that's turned over
to the filter between FET and antenna to be turned into
useful RF power.
The real neat thing about a switching type PA, is that
when the fet is hard ON, with its drain clamped firmly
down at zero volts, its not dissipating much power.
Yes, current is building in the choke, and you can't
stay here too long. We'll only be here for half a cycle.
Then the FET goes OFF - bang - current drops to
zero and the drain voltage starts swinging up. But
again, the FET dissipates no power, because there's
no current thru it. Beauty! When its ON - little power
dissipated - when its OFF - no power dissipated.
Things aren't THAT perfect - the FET takes a bit of
time to switch ON & OFF. During that switching time
it dissipates power. And some of the drive power
coming in the gate goes into heat too. And when
its ON, that small ohmic resistance dissipates a
bit of power (an amp thru half ohm is half watt, and
for only half the time - a total of quarter watt).

Overdriving has limits: your gate voltage swing must
stay below a swing from +20 to -20 v, or you'll puncture
the gate oxide (blown fet). And overdriving too far
wastes drive power too.

Subject: [125927] More MOSFET stuff

Gang,
Glen's post is excellent, and it addresses some of the discussion I have
been having with several of you privately, worth repeating here.

This discussion began about questioning why a certain MOSFET PA was
running so darn hot.  This is usually an indication of poor biasing or
overdriving the gate ... that is, for some percentage of the input RF,
you are drawing full drain current.  If this is a relatively small part
of the input sinewave, it's usually not a problem.  Helping people with
their mosfet PA's over the years, particularly those who built the
38-Special add-on mosfet PA (which was initially poorly biased), the main
problem I see is people increasing the gate bias to achieve maximum
output power.  Problem with this approach is when the input drive goes
to zero, the gate may be sitting with 4v or so bias, sufficient to keep
the mosfet drawing significant current.  With full input drive, it may
drive the gate into the 7-8v region allowing full drain current.  With a
SINEWAVE, if this full-drain current is occurring for too long each cycle,
you can dissipate a lot of power within the mosfet, which if severe
enough, will of course cause damage to the device.  Therefore in my
original post, I was trying to describe how to determine the useful
dynamic range of a mosfet gate drive, since every mosfet tends to have it's
own parameters.

A second point: while I mentioned that when entering the full drain
current region, the drain-source resistance drops to about 0.4 ohms for
the IRF510, this occurs ONLY for the period of time of full drain current,
not all the time.  The overall output resistance of the mosfet will be the
AVERAGE of the resistances seen over each cycle, and thus will be a bit
lower than the RL=Vcc^2/2Po value, not 0.4 ohms.  Of course the longer
you stay in the full drain current region, the lower your AVERAGE output
resistance will be.  Likewise, when in the full drain current region,
drawing around 5A, the AVERAGE drain current for each cycle will be
closer to the 1A (at 5W) level.  Again, the longer you stay in the
full drain current region, the higher the AVERAGE drain current will be,
but will never be excessively above 1A average.  The problem, however, is
the momentary "spikes" of 5A drain current can put a large strain on the
RFC feeding dc to the drain, possibly causing core saturation, and
another set of problems for the PA and output filtering.

Keep in mind, the above is based on feeding the mosfet with a SINEWAVE
input.  The more efficient mosfet PA's, such as those discussed by Glen,
are based on driving the mosfet with SQUAREWAVES.  This helps assure that
when the gate signal goes positive, driving the device into full drain
current, the drain voltage is very close to 0V for very little heat
dissipation in the device.  This is difficult to achieve with a sinewave
input, as there is a delay between the gate drive signal and the drain
signal due to charging up the relatively large (150pF) gate input
capacitance.  With a square wave, you are charging up this gate capacitance
very quickly, while with a sinewave input, you are charging it more
slowly, causing a longer delay, such that it is difficult to get maximum
drain current to coincide with zero drain voltage for a very long.  With
a squarewave drive, max. drain current at 0V drain voltage can exist for
20-30% of the cycle, in effect, expending virtually no power.

With a sinewave drive, you vary the mosfet output power by controlling
the peak-peak voltage of the gate drive.  The more drive, the more output
power (until you saturate in the full drain current region).  With a
squarewave drive, you control output power by controlling the duty cycle
of the squarewave.  That is, if the drive signal is "hi" for 10% of the
cycle, you are drawing full drain current for only 10% of the time and a
relatively low average output power results.  Increasing the input duty
cycle to 30%, means you are drawing full drain current for 30% of the
time, for significantly more output power.  This is called PWM, or "pulse
width modulation" technique.  In this case, we are not changing the
pulse width fast for the purpose of modulating the carrier, but changing
the pulse width on very slow time scales to change the output power.  On
a typical class E PA I have built using an IRF510, output power varies
from about 3W to 9W by varying the input duty cycle from about 10-40%.
Less than 10%, the mosfet gets unstable with high phase noise -- above
40%, drain current starts flowing so much of the time, you can stray
away from having full drain current at 0V drain voltage, and thus the
efficiency starts to suffer.  In the 10-40% drive, efficiencies in the
80% range are seen.  This means the IRF510 is comfortably warm even with
several minutes of solid keydown.  It also means it's drawing far less
battery current to make 5W than a PA running 50%, obviously.

I'm glad many of you are finding this discussion useful and informative.
Feel free to share with us your experiences.  Mosfet's are fun devices,
and capable of making a nice QRP PA in a properly designed circuit.  And
many of these points discussed by myself and others is why some people
claim they are making 5W and the IRF510 is scarcely warm, while others
are cooking eggs at 3W.

Hi Everyone, the recent FET thread has been great for
getting me into more building. Doing some searching to
find out different ways and means to use FETs in the QRP
projects has lead me to the following website. All I can say
is WoW, these folks are doing some serious transmitting with
FETs. Now, before you yell at me, just remember that they
are using modules composed of 4 FET units and then
combining them into serious high power Ham radio. Just
using one FET in the QRP projects with the Fairchild FQA11N90
which in small quantities cost around $2.50 is pretty
QRP to my shack budget.

An interesting comment from the author, "Right up front, I need to
say Don't build one of these if you don't have a good oscilloscope!
You will absolutely need a dual-trace scope to really ensure that
your transmitter is working correctly." That just amplifies what
Paul Harden, NA5N, has been telling us, is to get the circuit
components properly selected.

Take a look at http://www.netway.com/~stevec/ham/classe.htm#200w
there are also some great ideas at monitoring your FET circuits
and keeping them happy.
